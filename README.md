# Advent of Code, 2021

These are my answers for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021), they were written in [Stackline](https://github.com/adri326/stackline) (files ending in .sl) and in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (files ending in .rs).

Somes problems happen to be very tedious to answer in Stackline, so I ended up answering them in Rust instead.
